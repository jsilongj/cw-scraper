For this report, I am comparing my experiences with Haskell and
Python.  In particular, I have used the Scalpel scraping library in
Haskell, and the equivalent scrapy library in Python.

Code size: Code written was deliberate to be short and concise, which aims
	   to provide readbility. The use of haskell did shorten codes that would
	   have taken much more lines/complex in programming language such as Java which
	   ,for example, the removal of space and lowering case for ASCII can be 
           done but through the use of regular expression.


Code readability: The code density can be confusing at times. Thanks to haskell's
		  Syntactic sugar, the expressions becomes much more readable.
		  (e.g. [a,b,c] is sugar for (a:b:c:[])
		  However, too much syntactic sugar can also make the semantics unclear.
		  So it is important to strike a balance so that we are able to
		  code for program and code for readability.


Code maintainability: The code is properly commented so that the reader is able to
		      understand the meaning of the lines that was written, making 
		      the code easier to be maintained and understandable.


Toolchain support: Online support for Haskell is definitely much more limited in comparison
		   to the vast amount of community help that is available to programming
		   languages such as Java and Python. This makes developing of Haskell program
		   challenging.
