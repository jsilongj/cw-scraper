Some questions to consider:

Does your code build properly with "stack build"?
Yes, the code is able to build properly with "stack build".

Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in part
A?
No. All test cases were passed as well.

For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of
output did you generate?
Have attempted to generate output using google translate API binding but 
unable to implement due to time constraint. Hence, code was reverted.
